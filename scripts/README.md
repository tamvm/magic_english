### What the Script Does

1. **Finds Today's Cards**: Identifies all flashcards that were reviewed today
2. **Shows Preview**: Lists the cards that would be affected
3. **Resets Card State**: For each card:
   - If it was a new card today → Reset to "new" state
   - If it was reviewed before → Restore to previous state (before today's review)
4. **Cleans History**: Removes today's review history entries
5. **Shows Summary**: Reports success/failure counts

### Safety Features

- ⚠️ **Confirmation Required**: Script asks for confirmation before proceeding
- 🔍 **Dry Run Mode**: Always test with `--dry-run` first
- 📋 **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what will be changed
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if some cards fail
